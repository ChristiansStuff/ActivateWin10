# How to Activate Windows 10 for free using MAS!

**BEFORE DOING THIS PLEASE MAKE A RESTORE POINT: support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-a-system-restore-point-77e02e2a-3298-c869-9974-ef5658ea3be9**

**WHAT YOU NEED**
- A program to extract .7z files since the shitty Windows unarchiver does not work with .7z files (I recommend the 7-zip alpha build, the normal ones have not been updated since 2019. Download here: 7-zip.org)
- A brain.

**IMPORTANT THINGS TO NOTE**
- Disable your anti-virus and MS Defender before doing this, although the program is AV-friendly, do it just in case. 
How-to from Microsoft themselves: support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/turn-off-antivirus-protection-in-windows-security-99e6004f-c54c-8509-773c-a4d776b77960
- Check if your windows is activated, because why do this if it's already activated lol

- If you think this is a virus keep in mind that you can see the source code for yourself on the GitHub page.

**OK NOW BRING ME TO THE GOOD STUFF**
1. Go to github.com/massgravel/Microsoft-Activation-Scripts/releases
2. Once you go there, select the .7z file as the download (If there is a newer version then 1.4 then use that instead)

3. Save it wherever, Iâ€™d do it on the desktop for easier access.
4. Once you have the file installed, right click and extract it anywhere you want. I again chose my desktop because it's easier.
5. Put the password in. The password is 1234
6. There will be two folders, All-In-One-Version and Separate-Files-Version. We are going to be doing the All-In-One-Version since it's easier to use, so go in the All-In-One-Version folder.
7. Open the file that's in there.
8. You will be greeted with three options of activation, this may seem confusing, but **you should choose HWID activation.** KMS38 should only be used for activating Windows Servers and KMS should only be used for activating office.
9. Once you have decided from the flowchart above, select the method you want by choosing it then let the program do its magic.
10. Enjoy Windows 10 activated.
